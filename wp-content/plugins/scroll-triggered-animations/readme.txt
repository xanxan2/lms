== Frequently Asked Questions ==

 = How do I use my own CSS animations with advanced animations? = 

The advanced animations tab is for those of you who want that customisability factor. You can animate items on a global scope using your own CSS.

Your first step, is to activate the element you want to animate. You can activate any element by class, id or tag.

The plugin seeks out these items on the frontend of your site and adds the class ‘scroll-triggered’ as it enters your screens dimensions. This gives you the ability to target the element before and after it has entered your screen’s dimensions.

You're CSS could look something like this:

<code>.button { opacity:0; transform:translateY(10px); transition:all .5s; }</code>
<code>.button.scroll-triggered { opacity:1; transform:translateY(0); }</code>

Just remember to use the transition property to define how long you would like the animation to last.
